## Object detection based on Faster R-CNN  


## Introduction  

**Object detection** is an important part in advanced driver assistance systems.   

It can recognize and locate objects with computers instead of human intelligence.   

This project will talk about the development of R-CNN family

and mainly focus on Faster R-CNN to detect objects.  

## How to use

**Datasets** Googleâ€™s Open Images Dataset V4

train-images-boxable.csv file contains the image name and image url
Oidv6-train-annotations-bbox.csv file contains the bounding box info with the image id (name) and the image label name
class-descriptions-boxable.csv file contains the image label name corresponding to its class name
